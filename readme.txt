Security Issues

1. User should not be able to access every URL
2. User should not be able to scrap data simply via click.
3. The options page provides privilege to admin only to configure specific URLS and Paths to capture. 


Enhancement plans

3. add url inputs


In Popup 
1. Show preview of captures
2. The Captures should be limited to the current tab only
3. Export the captures as pdf 


In ContentScript 
1. Hover effect is only applicable to mentioned expaths in options. 
2. On click of capture button on Popup, that portion will be captured & stored in backgroud.js
