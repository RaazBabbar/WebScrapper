1. Wireframes has been created
2. Notification is working as a callback to export event 
3. A new example is availble, in which only 1 xpath element is captured as 
    a screenshot and exported as pdf. Just for demo.
4. pdf generation is possible without modular
    approach.

Pending 
1. Development of HTML and CSS of options screen

Mandatory Questions before proceedings
1. the xpath element has to be open, then only the app can capture it. So 
    user must open the xpath elements one by one and user has to wait
    as per the timer in each capture given in the notification
    . The app will automatically 
    capture these elements one by one when the user 
    crawl over these elements. After all xpaths are captured. 
    Export button will be enabled. The user can click and download pdf.
Just need a comfirmation before proceeding, because the implmentation 
of the above idea is going to be 
really complex in the programming point of view and will take ample time.
